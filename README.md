Data Visualization with Python" course week 5 final Assignment in coursera. 
I spent more than 5 hours to compete this assignment due to different errors during the assignment competion. 
Few of the errors I got " OS error (98) address already used","Synatx error in @app.callback" ,"Internal server error " and few others.
So decided to provide referance code to reuse whenever stucking during the assignment.
Hope it may help.
This code has with no erros and I got the charts as expected.
I attached graphs for referance as well in this repository.
